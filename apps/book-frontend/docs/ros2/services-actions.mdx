# ROS2 Services & Actions

## Overview
ROS2 communication is not just about continuous data streams.  
Some tasks require a **request and response**, while others require **long-running operations with feedback**.  
ROS2 solves these needs using **Services** and **Actions**, two communication patterns essential for real-world robots.

---

## Key Concepts
- **Service** — One request, one response; similar to a function call.  
- **Action** — A long-running task that provides feedback and a final result.  
- **Service Client** — The requester.  
- **Service Server** — The processor.  
- **Action Feedback** — Progress updates while executing a task.

## Detailed Explanation

### Services — Instant Request–Response  
A Service is used when a robot needs to:

- ask a question  
- compute a result  
- receive a reply immediately  

A Service has:

- a **Request**  
- a **Response**  
- a **Service name**

Good for tasks like:

- getting robot status  
- changing modes  
- requesting a computation  
- querying a sensor reading  

### Actions — Long-Running Tasks  
Actions are used for tasks that take time and must provide periodic updates.  
An Action includes:

- **Goal** — start the task  
- **Feedback** — progress messages  
- **Result** — final outcome  

Actions are essential for tasks like:

- walking to a target  
- running a grasping sequence  
- executing a navigation plan  
- charging or docking  
- scanning an area  

Actions can be **canceled**, which is critical for safety.

### Why This Matters for Humanoids
Humanoids use many simultaneous actions:

- arm movement planning  
- whole-body balance adjustments  
- walking trajectories  
- object manipulation  
- recovery reflexes  

Each action is asynchronous and interruptible — exactly what a humanoid robot needs in a dynamic environment.

## Example: Simple ROS2 Service

**Service definition (`AddTwoInts.srv`):**
int64 a
int64 b

int64 sum


**Calling the service:**
```bash
ros2 service call /add_two_ints example_interfaces/srv/AddTwoInts "{a: 3, b: 9}"

Example: Simple ROS2 Action

Send a goal to the Fibonacci action server:
ros2 action send_goal /fibonacci example_interfaces/action/Fibonacci "{order: 6}"

You will see:

feedback printed repeatedly

a final computed result

Real-World Application

Humanoid and industrial robots use Services & Actions constantly:

Services:

request object classification

read robot mode

reset controllers

Actions:

navigation goals

arm motion planning

manipulation sequences

locomotion and footstep planning

Companies like NVIDIA, Open Robotics, Agility Robotics, and Figure AI rely heavily on Actions for safe, predictable robot behavior.

Summary

Services handle instant request–response communication.

Actions manage long-running, interruptible tasks with feedback.

Together, they enable dynamic, robust, and safe humanoid robot behavior.
