# ROS2 Nodes, Topics & Communication

## Overview
ROS2 systems are made up of small, independent programs called *nodes*.  
These nodes communicate using *topics* through a publish–subscribe model.  
This chapter introduces the communication backbone of ROS2 and explains how data flows inside a robot, especially a humanoid robot with many sensors and controllers working simultaneously.

---

## Key Concepts
- **Node** — A single executable that performs one specific job.  
- **Topic** — A named communication channel used to exchange messages.  
- **Publisher** — A node that sends messages on a topic.  
- **Subscriber** — A node that listens for messages on a topic.  
- **Message Types** — Structured data formats (e.g., `sensor_msgs/Image`).  
- **Decoupling** — Nodes do not need to know each other's code; only the topic name and message type.

## Detailed Explanation
A robot is a collection of tasks happening simultaneously.  
Sensors read data, motors move joints, and higher-level AI modules make decisions.  
In ROS2, each task runs as a separate **node**, making the system:

- modular  
- scalable  
- easier to debug  
- distributed across multiple CPUs or machines  

### Topics & Publish–Subscribe
Nodes communicate using **topics**.  
A topic is simply a name like:

- `/camera/color`  
- `/joint_states`  
- `/imu/data`  

A *publisher* sends messages on a topic, and any *subscriber* listening to that topic receives the data immediately.

### Decoupling
Publishers and subscribers do not know about each other.  
This allows:

- swapping components easily  
- running multiple subscribers  
- replacing sensors without editing other code  

### Message Types
Standard message types (e.g., `geometry_msgs/Twist`, `sensor_msgs/Image`) ensure compatibility across the system.

### Humanoid Example
Humanoid robots may have dozens of topics:

- IMU → `/imu/data`  
- Foot pressure sensors → `/foot/pressure`  
- Vision → `/camera/rgb`  
- Joint controllers → `/joint/command`  

DDS ensures all this data is exchanged with low latency.

## Example
A simple ROS2 data flow for a walking humanoid:

1. Foot sensor node **publishes** weight distribution → `/foot/pressure`  
2. Balance node **subscribes** and computes stability  
3. Locomotion node **subscribes** and publishes joint angles → `/joint/command`  
4. Motor controllers **subscribe** and execute movement  

Each component is an independent node communicating through topics.

---

## Real-World Application
- Humanoids use topics to stream IMU data for balancing (hundreds of Hz).  
- Self-driving robots use camera + LiDAR topics for perception.  
- Industrial arms use safety topics to override motion instantly.  

Companies like **Boston Dynamics, Figure AI, Agility Robotics, and NVIDIA** design their communication systems around ROS2 topics and nodes.

---

## Summary
- Nodes are independent programs inside a robot.  
- Topics allow them to communicate using publish–subscribe messaging.  
- DDS provides fast, reliable communication.  
- This architecture makes humanoid robots modular, scalable, and safe.
