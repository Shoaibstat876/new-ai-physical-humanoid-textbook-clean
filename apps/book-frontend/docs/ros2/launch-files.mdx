# ROS2 Launch Files

## Overview
As robots grow more complex, they require many nodes to run simultaneously.  
Manually starting each node is inefficient and error-prone.  
ROS2 solves this using **launch files** — Python scripts that define:

- which nodes to start  
- what parameters to load  
- how the robot system should boot  

Launch files provide structure, automation, and scalability for real humanoid robots.

---

## Key Concepts

- **Launch File** — A Python script that starts multiple ROS2 nodes together.  
- **Node Action** — A command inside a launch file describing which node to run.  
- **Parameters** — Configuration values passed to nodes at startup.  
- **Launch Arguments** — Variables you can pass when running the launch file.  
- **Composability** — Ability to combine multiple launch files into a larger system.

## Detailed Explanation

A humanoid robot rarely runs a single node.  
It may require **20+ nodes**, such as:

- IMU drivers  
- Camera pipelines  
- Motor controllers  
- Whole-body control  
- Localization  
- Mapping  
- Planning  

Starting these manually is unrealistic in real deployments.

### What Is a Launch File?

A launch file typically lives inside:

my_robot/launch/start_robot.py

It uses ROS2’s Launch API to:

- start nodes  
- set parameters  
- create namespaces  
- include other launch files  

---

### Why Launch Files Matter

Launch files provide:

- repeatable robot startup  
- automated configuration  
- scalable system boot processes  

Instead of typing 10–30 commands, you run:

ros2 launch my_robot start_robot.py

---

## Conditional Logic

Launch files can behave differently depending on arguments:

- **simulation mode** → load Gazebo, fake sensors  
- **hardware mode** → start real motor drivers, camera pipelines  

---

## Launch Arguments

Arguments allow runtime customization:

ros2 launch my_robot start_robot.py robot_model:=humanoid_v2 debug:=true

No code changes required.

---

## Example — Simple Launch File

A launch file that starts two nodes:

from launch import LaunchDescription
from launch_ros.actions import Node

def generate_launch_description():
    return LaunchDescription([
        Node(
            package='demo_nodes_cpp',
            executable='listener',
            name='my_listener'
        ),
        Node(
            package='demo_nodes_cpp',
            executable='talker',
            name='my_talker'
        )
    ])

### Running it:

ros2 launch my_package simple_launch.py

---

## Real-World Application

Humanoid robots depend heavily on launch files.

### Startup Launch  
Starts:

- IMU  
- joint-state publishers  
- motor drivers  
- robot_state_publisher  

### Perception Launch  
Starts:

- camera drivers  
- depth pipelines  
- vision AI nodes  

### Navigation Launch  
Starts:

- SLAM  
- local + global planners  
- costmaps  

Companies like **Boston Dynamics**, **Agility Robotics**, **Figure AI**, and **Open Robotics** coordinate their entire humanoid boot processes using launch files.

---

## Summary

- Launch files automate multi-node ROS2 systems.  
- They support parameters, arguments, and composability.  
- They are essential for humanoids with complex AI + control stacks.  
- With one command, the entire robot becomes operational.
