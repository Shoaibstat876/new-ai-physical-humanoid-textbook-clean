# Importing Humanoid & Robot Assets in Isaac Sim

## Overview
Isaac Sim supports importing robot models from many formats, including **URDF, USD, MJCF, and custom meshes**.  
This chapter explains how to bring a humanoid robot or any robotic system into the simulation environment.  
You will learn how to prepare assets, fix scaling issues, configure materials, and ensure the robot behaves physically correct.

## Key Concepts

- **URDF Import** — Convert standard robotics models into Isaac-ready USD files.  
- **USD Assets** — Native Omniverse format for stable, fast simulation.  
- **Joint & Articulation Mapping** — Ensuring the imported robot behaves realistically.  
- **Scaling & Orientation Fixes** — Handling mismatched units or flipped axes.  
- **Material & Collider Setup** — Making the robot interact properly with physics.

## Detailed Explanation

Isaac Sim uses **USD (Universal Scene Description)** as its core asset format.  
Most robotics developers start with URDF, so Isaac Sim includes tools to convert URDF → USD.

### **1. URDF Import**
URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) is common in ROS and robotics research.

Isaac Sim’s URDF importer automatically maps:

- Links → rigid bodies  
- Joints → articulations  
- Collisions → colliders  
- Visual meshes → render geometries  

After import, you can adjust:

- Joint limits  
- Mass & inertia  
- Physics materials  
- Collider accuracy  

This ensures realistic performance.

### **2. USD Assets (Native Format)**
USD is optimized for:

- Large environments  
- Multi-robot scenes  
- High-performance GPU simulation  

Robots stored in USD load faster and behave more consistently than directly using URDF.

A typical humanoid USD file has:

- A root prim  
- Articulation hierarchy  
- Colliders  
- Materials  
- Sensors (optional)  

USD also supports nondestructive edits, letting you override parts without breaking the entire robot.

### **3. Fixing Scaling & Orientation**
Many imported robots have issues like:

- Being too small or too large  
- Facing the wrong direction  
- Misaligned joints  

To fix these:

- Set **metersPerUnit** to match real-world meters.  
- Apply transforms at the root prim.  
- Recalculate mass/inertia after scaling.  

For humanoids, realism requires correct foot size, limb lengths, and joint orientations.

### **4. Material & Collider Setup**
Imported meshes sometimes have poor or missing colliders.  
Replace mesh colliders with:

- Capsules for limbs  
- Boxes for torso  
- Simple shapes for feet  

This avoids simulation instability.

Materials also matter:

| Part | Recommended Material |
|------|----------------------|
| Feet | High friction (0.8–1.0) |
| Hands | Medium friction (0.5–0.7) |
| Torso | Low friction to avoid sticking |

### **5. Testing the Imported Asset**
After import, always verify the robot by:

1. Dropping it under gravity  
2. Checking if it stands correctly  
3. Manually actuating joints  
4. Ensuring no jitter or explosion occurs  
5. Playing an example animation (walking, grasping)

This confirms physics constraints are correct.

## Example

Import a simple humanoid URDF:

1. Open **Isaac Sim → URDF Importer**  
2. Select `humanoid.urdf`  
3. Choose:

- *Fix base* = off  
- *Self-collisions* = on  
- *Convex decomposition* = on  

4. Import and convert to USD  
5. Edit colliders and materials  
6. Test articulation movement  
7. Save final robot to:

`/Assets/Robots/Humanoid/humanoid.usd`

Now the humanoid is ready for walking, reinforcement learning, or manipulation tasks.

## Real-World Application

Companies like **Figure**, **Tesla**, **Agility Robotics**, and **1X** import humanoid models into simulation to:

- Test locomotion algorithms  
- Predict hardware failures  
- Train reinforcement learning agents  
- Validate actuators before physical trials  

Simulation reduces cost and prevents hardware damage.

## Summary

- Isaac Sim supports URDF, USD, and mesh-based robot imports.  
- USD is the most stable and recommended format.  
- Fix scaling, orientation, materials, and colliders after import.  
- Proper setup ensures realistic humanoid simulation.  
- Asset quality directly affects training and behavior performance.
