# Defining the Capstone Problem

## Overview
Every successful robotics system begins with a clear, meaningful problem. In this chapter, you will learn how to define a precise problem statement for your Capstone project. A well-structured definition ensures that your design, simulation, control, and AI components all align toward one achievable goal. This is the foundation upon which your entire Capstone will be built.

## Key Concepts
- **Problem Scope** — Define exactly what the robot must accomplish.
- **Environment & Constraints** — Identify the physical or simulated conditions.
- **Success Criteria** — Decide what counts as a “successful” performance.
- **Assumptions** — Clarify what you expect from sensors, hardware, or the environment.
- **System Boundaries** — Determine what is inside and outside your responsibility.

## Detailed Explanation

### 1. Why Problem Definition Matters
In robotics engineering, weak problem definition leads to poor system design. If you don’t clearly define the task, your sensors, algorithms, and control loops will feel disconnected. A strong problem definition helps you:
- Choose the right tools  
- Select meaningful data  
- Design better control and perception systems  
- Avoid unnecessary complexity  

This step transforms your Capstone from an idea into a real engineering project.

### 2. Components of a Strong Problem Statement
A complete problem statement answers these questions:

- **What is the robot supposed to do?**  
  (Pick one meaningful behavior such as navigating, lifting, assisting, detecting, answering.)

- **Where will it operate?**  
  (Environment: classroom, office, warehouse, lab, outdoor walkway.)

- **What constraints exist?**  
  (Lighting, obstacles, battery limits, terrain, user interaction rules.)

- **What information does the robot need?**  
  (Objects, human gestures, environment mapping.)

- **What counts as success?**  
  (E.g., accuracy threshold, stable walking time, detection rate, response quality.)

### 3. Writing a Clear Problem Definition
To help you structure yours, here is a simple template:

**Problem Definition Template**
1. **Objective:**  
   Describe the main task.

2. **Environment:**  
   Describe the simulation or real-world environment.

3. **Robot Capabilities Needed:**  
   Sensors, locomotion, control, perception, communication.

4. **Assumptions:**  
   Anything you expect to be true (e.g., stable lighting, ideal sensors, simplified physics).

5. **Success Criteria:**  
   When will you consider your Capstone successful?

### 4. Example Problem Definition
**Example: Classroom Assistance Humanoid**

- **Objective:**  
  A humanoid robot assists in a classroom by answering student questions and detecting raised hands.

- **Environment:**  
  A simulated classroom in Isaac Sim with desks, chairs, and 6–10 student avatars.

- **Robot Capabilities Needed:**  
  - Vision system for gesture recognition  
  - Audio/LLM-based conversational module  
  - Balancing + basic walking  
  - ROS 2 node controlling perception and decision-making  

- **Assumptions:**  
  - Good lighting  
  - Stable network connection  
  - Pre-trained detection models  

- **Success Criteria:**  
  - ≥85% accuracy in hand detection  
  - Correct answer rate ≥90% for factual questions  
  - Robot remains stable for ≥60 seconds during interaction  

This is a realistic, industry-style example of a well-formed robotics task.

## Real-World Application
At engineering companies, problem definition is a required step before teams write a single line of code.  
For example:
- Tesla defines “Retrieve pickup object X in environment Y under constraint Z.”
- Boston Dynamics defines “Maintain balance during dynamic motion.”
- Amazon Robotics defines “Navigate warehouse aisles with specific safety constraints.”

Your Capstone follows the same professional workflow.

---

## Summary
- A clear problem definition is the foundation of your Capstone project.  
- It describes what the robot must do, where it will operate, and how success is measured.  
- This step ensures your system architecture, control, perception, and simulation choices all align.  
- You now have the template to write your own professional-grade problem statement.
