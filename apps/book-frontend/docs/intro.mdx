## What You Will Find in This Textbook

### **Foundations**
Core concepts of Physical AI, embodiment, sensors, perception, kinematics, and why humanoids matter.

### **Humanoid Robotics**
Deep-dive into locomotion, balance, manipulation, learning, safety, software architecture, and real-world deployment.

### **Simulation / Isaac Sim**
How to train policies, build environments, simulate sensors, and transfer skills from simulation to hardware.

### **ROS2 Robotics Framework**
The communication backbone of real robots:
- nodes, topics, services  
- actions  
- parameters  
- launch files  
- full system orchestration  

### **Capstone Project**
