# Day 01 – 2025-12-08

## What happened today

- Created a brand-new spec-driven project at  
  `D:\new-ai-physical-humanoid-textbook`.

- Initialized SpecKit Plus using:  
  `specifyplus init . --ai claude --script ps`.

- Created the main project folders:
  - apps/
  - docs-project/
  - history/

- Added the **Project Constitution**.
- Added two initial specs:
  - system-architecture.md
  - textbook-structure.md

## Notes

- The old project at `C:\Users\Shoaib\Documents\ai-physical-humanoid-textbook`
  will be used **only as reference** for content and code.
- All new development will follow specs and plans.
